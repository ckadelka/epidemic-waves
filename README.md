# Adaptive human behavior and delays in information availability autonomously modulate epidemic waves

This repository contains all code to run the behavioral-epidemiological infectious disease model, developed in the manuscript ["Adaptive human behavior and delays in information availability autonomously modulate epidemic waves"]{https://www.medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.11.23.24317838v1}. The Python code was developed using Python 3.11.

The key file is model.py, which employs the just-in-time compiler [Numba]{https://numba.pydata.org} to speed up the computation of model dynamics.
